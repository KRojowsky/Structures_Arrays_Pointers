Write a program in which there will be:
1. A declared structure consisting of a dynamic array of real numbers and a variable that stores its size; 
2. A function that creates an array in the structure; 
3. A function that frees the memory allocated to the array; 
4. A function that fills the array with random valuesfrom the range specified by the userâ€“ its argument is to be a structure, the function returns nothing. 
5. Array sorting function - its argument is to be a structure, the function returns nothing. 
6. Function that calculates the sum of all elements - its argument is to be a structure, the function returns the calculated value. 
7.finding the smallest element of the array - its argument is to be a structure, the function returns the calculated value. 
8. Function finding the largest element of the array - its argument is to be the structure, the function returns the calculated value. 

In main() you should declare a variable whose type will be the above-mentioned structure. Then fill it and use all functions on it. Functions 4 and 5 as well as 6, 7, 8 should be called using the appropriate pointer. 

Functions supporting the structure and the structure itself should be declared in the .h file, and function bodies in the .c file
